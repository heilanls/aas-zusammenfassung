		\subsection{Components}
			Components are the result of decomposition of a system.
			
		\subsection{Connectors}
			Connectors connect components.
		
		\subsection{Constraints}
			Components must be constrained to provide that
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the required functionality is achieved
				\item no functionality is duplicated
				\item the required performance is achieved
				\item the requirements are met
				\item modularity is realized (e.g. which modules interact with
				the operating system)
			\end{itemize}
		
		\subsection{Rationales}
